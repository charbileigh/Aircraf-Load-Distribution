    """
    Background info of the program:
    This code is created to open a csv file, then create a matrix of our distances. then it is bound togo to an extent where is uses the guassian elimination method to get
    the inverse and thenmultiplying that with the necessary matrix tho get the distributed load. then from there it needs to integrate the funtion to get co-efficients
    for the shear an the bending moment, then get the constances, and thenafter this this code is going to allow us to know the bending moment of an aircraft wing then
    we create an output csv file. from this we can deduce the mechanical stresses using the correct equation and many more stuffs
